Chapter One unit, one breakfast dialogue.

Good morning. What would you like to order for breakfast?

I'd like to order a cup of black coffee, a slice of toast and scrambled eggs.

Please, ok, one moment please five minutes later.

Here you are enjoy your breakfast.

By the way we offer free coffee refills. Thank you very much.
